        <h2 class="section-title text-3xl md:text-[48px] mb-6!">My role, achievements and outcomes</h2>
        <p class="talk-desc mb-6!">
          I led the work setting our ZDS figma libraries, tokens (variables, components properties, etc.) I put in place
          a changelog and a branching process for our updates and explorations. I also set up a plan to integrate future
          versions of the library and a migration plan without touching the current one so it won’t break our consumers
          experience.
        </p>
        <p class="talk-desc mb-6!">
          I created a plugin to migrate from figma colour styles to variables. And also a plugin to swap an update our
          tokens version following our style dictionary repository.
        </p>
        <p class="talk-desc mb-6!">
          I also set up our typography variables to allow the 200% mode to emulate text resizing so our designers could
          test this accessibility feature in advance.
        </p>
        <p class="talk-desc mb-6!">
          Finally, I led the Figma training during 3 seasons for the Zalando design community where I level up product
          and content designers to make the most use of Figma advanced features like Autolayout, Components, Variables
          and Prototyping. Now I’m part of the team recording vide training about these and other topics. These videos
          are part of an official training in Workday for our community. On top of this, I have done workshops about how
          to build Figma plugins and how to use AI tools like Cursor so designers cna build their own ideas having deep
          technical knowledge.

          This tool helps migrating mocks using colour styles to variables (tokens). The plugin helped designers to save
          many hours of manual work and was widely used in the early days once we launched design tokens boosting their
          adoption from day one.

            challenging manual work. Having 8 modes for our 3 themes, making changes and updates was prone to errors,
            easy to miss and hard to track what was done. On top of that having multiple Style dictionary folders made
            impossible to keep track of the different versions.

          This plugin sync our tokens repo with our variables in our Figma library. Beside this it can swap the tokens
          override to one of the different Style dictionary versions of our tokens that are currently used for the A/B
          tests that are set before the full launch the Zalando bran refresh. These dictionaries include new typography,
          updated and removed colours, adding border radius among other changes.

          I explored creating more flexible and fully responsive components. This was mainly done for some of our core
          e-comerce components like Product cards where we went from having 13 separate components with around 100
          variants in total to 1 component and 6 variants. Also, our Showstopper component was redesigned to be fully
          responsive going form 48 to 4 variants.
